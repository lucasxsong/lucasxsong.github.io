            i started writing down my thoughts so that i could keep track and look back on ideas and thoughts that i had. here are a few muddled and unedited essays that i've written. these are mostly rambles, dont judge please!

                    i was lucky enough to create this project during github's recent service outage on october 20th. lucky seems to be a weird way to describe this unfortunate timing, so i will attempt to elaborate what i learned from my experience.

                <br> 
                    bored on sunday, i had a great idea to start a repository to document a collection of my thoughts. more specifically, it would be a personal journal of little things that i thought i should write down.
                <br> 
                <br>                     
                    as i loaded up github, i created a new repository. as the website prompted me for a name, i thought for a quick second, and typed out "getting better at doing work." the name did a pretty good job of describing what the repo would involve, and that seemed good enough to me. as i tried to connect to the repo, i was confronted with the error message "Error: Repository not found"
                <br> 
                <br>                     
                    weird, I thought to myself. I double checked the repository URL that github had conveniently copied to my clipboard, and made sure that i hadn't accidentally fatfingered anything. it looked good, so i went back to github to check if perhaps the repository had not been set up properly. since i  had accidentally closed the tab, i navigated to my repositories to re-open the page. to my dismay, "getting better at doing work" had disappeared from my repositories, nowhere to be found. i gave a quick look around, but found no clue as to that repsitory having ever existed.
                <br> 
                <br>                     
                    even weirder, i had went through all the steps of creating a repo and it had just seemingly disappeared off of my account. i chalked it up to me being a github noob, perhaps i had missed a step during repo creation that had resulted in the repo not being saved. oh well.
                <br> 
                <br>                     
                    i decided to just start over and make a new repo, making sure that i followed every instruction during creation in detail. as the website prompted me again to re-enter a name, i sat and thought for a second. the repo name that i previously put down seemed a little long, and even though it did describe what i wanted to do pretty well, it didn't seem as concise as it could have been. this time, i decided to call the repo "do work good." a little bit of me liked the way it sounded. as i continued to try to clone the repo on my laptop, my terminal spit back the same message "Error: Repository not found." 
                <br> 
                <br>                     
                    I later found out that Github was migrating a data storage system, and was experiencing inconsistencies with user data. however, in the moment, i was baffled. i had done the same in creating this repository as i did for the repos i had to make for my classes. i began to brainstorm what could have gone wrong. i realized that instead of "cloning" the repo, i had actually just set up the repo as a remote repository using git remote add origin. it seemed weird that maybe this error had caused the repo to delete itself, but as a noob to git and github, i thought that maybe it was just part of a bigger concept that i had failed to understand.
                    
                    so i set out to create a new repo, yet again. this time, when i tried to enter my "do work good" name, github spit back an error "A repository of this name already exists." i returned to my repositories, and checked to see if it was, in fact, there. seemingly taunting me, github showed no repositories under that name. i returned to create a new repo in frustration, hoping to bootstrap a solution by just creating a new repo under a new name and seeing if cloning it would work.
                <br> 
                <br>                     
                    as i realized that the repo's purpose was just to give me some more time to familiarize myself with git, i wrote "getting better at git and work." too long. i revised it to "get good at work," in inspiration of my "erased" second repo. suddenly, i realized what i wanted to name it. "git good." concise enough to be easily typed, but also conveying what the repo was to me. i created this final repo, hoping to finally clone it and start writing. however, as expected, the repo disappeared, yet again. in frustration, i finally realized that maybe it wasn't myfault. a quick google search revealed that the problem was not in my novice git skills, but that github was, in fact, down.  
                <br> 
                <br>                     
                    this experience taught me a few things. in my struggle with cloning/pushing to the repo, i picked up a few more command line shortcuts to help broaden my knowledge of learning how to use terminal more effectively. in addition, i has been reaffirmed that google is your best friend. however, the most important that i think i have taken away from this frustrating and troubleshooting filled night is the important of revision. although the slight changes in my repo names from my first to my third revision aren't going to affect the way i use this repo too much, they are important in that i now realize that forced revision can help in ways unimaginable. 
                <br> 
                <br>                     
                    when i entered the first name for the repo, it worked. however, i didn't know to what extent it could be improved, shortened, or changed. it was only through the revisions that github forced me through that i realized how much i could improve the repo name.
                <br> 
                <br>                     
                    during the same time that github was down, i had to work on an assignment for my CS61 class. i had procrastinated and had failed to fork the assignment files, and was unable to fork them because of github's outage. since i didn't want to wait til github was repaired, i started the project based on specifications that had been posted online. when github finally did come back up, and i successfully forked the repo, i had to rewrite the code that i had previously written into the format of the assignment files that the teacher wanted. in the rewrite, i caught a multitude of errors and redundancies that i had overlooked before, and felt like i had a much more deeper understanding of how my code worked.
                <br> 
                <br>                     
                    revisions seem boring. if the code works, why rewrite it? although my code may work, i might be missing out on dozens of memory leaks or inefficient algorithms if i decide to just finalize the code once it works. github outage on sunday into a good bit of monday most definitely wreaked havok to millions of users. however, for me, i am happy that i have experienced first-hand the importance of forced revision.
