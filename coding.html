            in the 2 years of formal computer science education that i have had, i have grown to enjoy the many hours sitting in front of my computer trying to debug hopeless seg faults. i am trying to explore as much of cs as possible in hopes of seeing what i like doing the most! here are a few projects that i am working on. 
            <ul> <b>lead backend dev </b>at <a href = "https://mindtapp.com" target = "_blank"> mindtapp</a>, a psychological development app </ul>

            <ul> <b> frontend dev </b> at <a href = "https://github.com/typrant/typrant" target = "_blank"> typrant</a>, a game that will hopefully make learning how to type fast enjoyable. i think the concept of this game is sick because i realized that i learned how to type from countless hours chatting at the grand exchange on runescape, and im sure theres an easier way to go about teaching kids how to type. </ul>

            <ul> besides that, i try to do a leetcode problem a day and am trying to learn how to use the machine learning library <a href = "https://keras.io" target = "_blank"> keras</a>. </ul>
