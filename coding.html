            in the 2 years of formal computer science education that i have had, i have grown to enjoy the many hours sitting in front of my computer trying to debug hopeless seg faults. i am trying to explore as much of cs as possible in hopes of seeing what i like doing the most! here are a few projects that i have worked on.

            <ul> <b> shoom </b> is a personalized search engine that makes it easier for you to find and organize info on tech/frameworks. i worked on this with my friends <a href = "cameronmorin.com">cameron</a> and natasha at hack uci. this was a fun project that taught me a lot about making web apps! <a href = "https://www.github.com/lucasxsong/shoom" target = "./blank"> shoom on github </a> </ul> 

            <span> <img src = "./img/shoomHome.png">  <img src = "./img/shoomResults.png"> </span>

            <ul> <b>backend dev </b>at <a href = "https://mindtapp.com" target = "_blank"> mindtapp</a>, a psychological development app </ul>

            <ul> <b> frontend dev </b> at <a href = "https://github.com/typrant/typrant" target = "_blank"> typrant</a>, a game that will hopefully make learning how to type fast enjoyable. i think the concept of this game is sick because i realized that i learned how to type from countless hours chatting at the grand exchange on runescape, and im sure theres an easier way to go about teaching kids how to type. </ul>

            <ul> besides that, i try to do a leetcode problem a day and am trying to learn how to use the machine learning library <a href = "https://keras.io" target = "_blank"> keras</a>. </ul>

            <ul> here is my <a href = "https://github.com/lucasxsong" target = "_blank"> github </a> </ul>
