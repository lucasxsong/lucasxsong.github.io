            <i> the power of habit </i> is a great book by carol dwerek that talks about the importance of your daily habits. one part of the book even mentioned how the introduction of exercising every day positively impacts your sleep, eating habits, and mental health. i decided to try to set a goal of trying to work out every day. <br>  <br>  as i grew more into fitness, i began to learn about the sport of powerlifting. powerlifting is a sport in which people compete in 3 lifts: bench, squat, and deadlift. the goal is to lift as much weight as you can in these three lifts. even from the start, i felt like i truly enjoyed powerlifting more than other disciplines in fitness because of how easily quantified success in the sport was. if you worked hard at the gym, it was easy to track your progress as your weight in the big three lifts would rise. additionally, if you had a bad night of sleep, or skipped lunch that day, your working weight would show that too. i think this concept of "numbers not lying" is why i became so interested in the sport. since i started climbing, i dont lift as much as i usually do, but i still love the occasional deadlift or squat session.
