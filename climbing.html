            rock climbing is pretty much my favorite hobby at the moment. i mainly sport climb and boulder at the moment. sport climbing, in short, is using a rope to scale taller rock walls. bouldering typically encompasses anything under that height range and utilizes a cushiony crash pad to protect from falls. climbing is a combination of physical strength, problem solving, great opportunities to go outdoors, and awesome friends. i currently work at the rock wall @ ucr, and i love my job! if you are interested in climbing, but don't know where to start, please reach out and i will try my best to help where i can. if you're an experienced climber, i'm always down for a climbing session in the gym or at a local crag.
