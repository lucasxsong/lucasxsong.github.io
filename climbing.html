            i started climbing around march 2018, and it has quickly grown to be my favorite hobby. i mainly sport climb and boulder at the moment. sport climbing, in short, is using a rope to scale taller rock walls. bouldering typically encompasses anything under that height range and utilizes a cushiony crash pad to protect from falls. climbing is a combination of physical strength, problem solving, great opportunities to go outdoors, and awesome friends. i currently work at the rock wall @ ucr, and i love my job! if you are interested in climbing, but don't know where to start, please reach out and i will try my best to help where i can. if you're an experienced climber, i'm always down for a climbing session in the gym or at a local crag. <br> 

            <br> i currently climb around v7 indoor and v5 outdoor. i have set a goal to climb a v8 outdoor by my birthday on april 23, 2019, and hopefully my first multipitch climb by january 1, 2020. these are pretty ambitious goals, but i think that if i train correctly and manage my sleep and nutrition proplery,  i might be able to complete them!
