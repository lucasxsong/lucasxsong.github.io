            climbing is pretty much my favorite hobby at the moment. a combination of physical strength, mental sharpness, great opportunities to go outdoors, and awesome friends make it a big and happy part of my life. i'm setting a goal to climb half dome by the end of college.   <a href = "https://www.mountainproject.com/user/200377277/lucas-song" target = "_blank"> mountain project account</a>.
