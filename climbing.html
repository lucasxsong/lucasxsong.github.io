        <div class = "subtext"> 
            i started climbing around march 2018, and it has quickly grown to be my favorite hobby. i mainly sport climb and boulder at the moment, but am looking to get into trad. <br> 

            <br> i currently climb around v8 indoor and v5 outdoor. i have a personal goal to climb a v8 outdoor by my birthday on april 23, 2019, and hopefully my first multipitch climb by january 1, 2020. these are pretty ambitious goals, but i think that if i train correctly and manage my sleep and nutrition properly,  i might be able to complete them! 
            <br> 

             <img class = "fa" src = './img/fa.png' align = "right"> <BR CLEAR=”left” />  im also in the process of creating a <b> rock climbing club </b> for ucr called <a href = "https://highlanderlink.ucr.edu/organization/firstascent" target = "_blank">first ascent</a>. we are hoping to provide opportunities for discounted gym membership and outdoor climbing trips to joshua tree, black mountain (when the road gets fixed), riverside quarry, and more. heres a logo i made for the club! 

            <br> 
            <br> if you go to ucr, and wish to join, please message me and i will add you to our slack chat! <br>
