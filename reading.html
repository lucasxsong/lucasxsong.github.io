            <b> i am currently reading: </b> <br> 
            - <i> principles</i>, by ray dalio <br>
            <br> 

            <b> here are a few books that i enjoyed reading: </b> <br> <br>
            - <i> the power of habit </i>: this is the first book that i read going into college, and it really changed my perspective on how i view habits. i learned about how important habits really were, and vowed to start going to the gym every day because of the diet, sleep, and work habits that came from that one simple habit. this book has, for better or worse, changed me into a gym rat... i cannot skip a day without going to the gym without feeling lazy. on a more serious note, i am trying to develop my skill of picking up habits so that i can live a more healthy and automated life thanks to my basal ganglia! <b> would definitely recommend if you want to learn about how to use habits, aka your brain's autopilot, to your benefit </b><br>  <br>
            - <i> a mind for numbers </i>: this book reaffirmed as well as taught me a few things about myself in terms of how i learn. i was taught growing up to study in long dreary sessions, and grew to hate them since i tended to lose focus within the first hour. now, i know that i perform a lot better working in bursts, in a modified format of the pomodoro timer, and have a lot of learning tidbits to add to my toolkit. <b>would definitely recommend if you are interested in learning more efficiently!</b><br> <br>

            
            - <i> how to win friends and influence people <i></i> <br>
            - <i> the breaking point </i><br>
            <br> 

            <b> here are a few books that i am looking forward to reading: </b><br>
            - the intelligent investor <br> 
            - game theory <br>
            - letters from a skeptic <br>
            - power of now <br>
