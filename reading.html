            - <a href = "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12935037-principles" target = "_blank"><b><i> principles</i></a>, by ray dalio  <br></b> i feel like ive always heard the title of this book thrown around, but never actually got around to reading it. i finally came around to reading it when i heard naval ravikant reference it in <a href = "https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=5&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwi5x_L58ubgAhXC3J4KHZxjDKUQFjAEegQIBxAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Ffs.blog%2Fnaval-ravikant%2F&usg=AOvVaw2Ud6FSAhHp3IZOSirhlCZq" target = "_blank">the angel philosopher</a>, which is a great podcast that my sister told me about. the book itself is divided into three portions, a little bit of backstory on ray dalio, principles for life and principles for work. ray dalio started and now manages one of the biggest hedge funds in the world, so it was great to have access to the mental models that he uses to manage his life and weigh decisions. i especially enjoyed his dialogue on painful problems, first/second/third degree consequences/rewards, and the constant battle of conscious vs subconscious.

            - <a href = "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12609433-the-power-of-habit" target = "_blank"><b> <i> the power of habit</a>,</i> by charles duhigg </b> <br>  this is the first book that i read going into college, and it really changed my perspective on how i view habits. i learned about how important habits really were, and vowed to start going to the gym every day because of the diet, sleep, and work habits that came from that one simple habit. this book has, for better or worse, changed me into a gym rat... i need to visit the gym once a day otherwise i will feel like a failure . (more on this in <a href "powerlifting.html"> powerlifting</a>) on a more serious note, i am trying to develop my skill of picking up habits so that i can live a more healthy and automated life thanks to my basal ganglia!<br> <b> tldr: how to use habits, aka your brain's autopilot, to your benefit </b><br>  <br>
            
            - <a href = "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18693655-a-mind-for-numbers" target = "_blank"> <b> <i> a mind for numbers </a> </i>, by barbara oakley </b> <br>   my mentor <a href = "https://pham.codes" target = "_blank">john</a> recommended this book when i asked about study tips or advice that he had. this book reaffirmed as well as taught me a few things about myself in terms of how i learn. i was taught growing up to study in long dreary sessions, and grew to hate them since i tended to lose focus within the first hour. now, i know that i perform a lot better working in bursts, in a modified format of the pomodoro timer, and have a lot of learning tidbits to add to my toolkit. <br> <b>tldr: learn how to learn more efficiently!</b><br> <br>
